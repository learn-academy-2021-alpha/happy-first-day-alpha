# Happy First Day Alpha

This is the first repository you will clone. A respository is a folder on GitHub that holds files of code. Cloning a respository is the process of copying the folder from GitHub to your individual computer (aka your local machine) where you can have access to the code. There is a connection to GitHub that is held by that folder and allows developers to make updates to the code and update what is held on GitHub. This is a VERY important part of working on a development team.
